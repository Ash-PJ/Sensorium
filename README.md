# Sensorium
This project captures and processes depth data from a Kinect sensor, segments the depth image into smaller groups, thresholds the depth values into discrete levels, and sends the processed data to an Arduino via serial communication. The primary applications of this project include depth-based interaction and real-time visualization of depth data.
